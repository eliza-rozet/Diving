                <p class="mbr-text align-center display-5 pb-3 mbr-fonts-style">I found this FYI project really enjoyable and challenging at the same time. I enjoyed putting together this project as well as researching. This was a great way to help me seek further in becoming a more confident diver and understanding the history behind diving. One thing I would have liked to do differently was to dig deeper into researching more on diving. I loved seeing my project come together and get other people’s opinions on ideas or suggestions to make my project better. A challenge that I had to work around was researching certain questions as diving was a hard topic, but I managed to find answers and research to help me answer my questions. Also coming up with questions was a challenge but I kept working at it and if ended up with a good wide range of questions for diving. I developed a different range of skills throughout my project, some of them were taking other people’s ideas on board and giving them a go, working with a website page I was unfamiliar with and adapting to that and building on my research skills by not only looking online but also in books or videos. By developing these skills, it has successfully helped me pursue my project and to show my passion for diving.&nbsp;<br></p>

            <div class="mbr-white col-md-10">
                <h1 class="mbr-section-title align-center pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-1">Reflection&nbsp;</h1>
                <p class="mbr-text align-center display-5 pb-3 mbr-fonts-style">At the beginning of my project, it took some time to come up with suitable questions but after I felt like I was becoming confident in my project. Then I had to find suitable information for my questions, this was more of a challenge as diving is a hard topic to research. After finding reasherch I realised I need to find more if I wanted to put more detail into my project, so this took a bit of time as I said its a challenge to find suitable answers. at the end of this stage, I had enough note-taking and information to put my project together. 
<br>
<br>with putting together my note taking, I it out into table and groups to see what pieces of information go with what question. the tables and columns really helped me to put together the information I had and to help me write my paragraphs.   
<br>
<br>I quite enjoyed the challenging aspect of this project which was creating the website. after completing my website I felt satisfied with my work and the time I took to make the website. I had developed a new skill which I'm excited to take on board to use for other tasks. 
<br>
<br>in each double lesson, I made sure I accomplished as much as I could to help bring this website together. Also in each lesson, I wanted to move to another part of my project just so I felt like I was moving along smoothly and had my work under control. At home, I managed to put in a lot of effort which helped get ahead so when I came to the double lesson I was aware of what I had to get done. I loved getting feedback from my teacher and friends to help make my project. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br></p>
